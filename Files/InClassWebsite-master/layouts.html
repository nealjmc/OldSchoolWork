    <h2>Layouts</h2>
    <p>As have stated many time, mechanical keyboards come in many different shapes and sizes. What exactly does this mean though?</p>

    <p>Where you live plays a big part in your keyboard layout. There are many other different layouts based on
      where you are in the world, some of the most common are Qwerty, Dvorak, and Colemak
      Differences between them all are normally where special character, and letters are placed on the keyboard.</p>

      <p>There are many different key variations, and how the keyboard is laid out. Depending on where you buy the keyboard, and what brands, this can vary. ANSI vs ISO keyboard layouts are the most common. There are very subtle differences in their layouts. This include the spacebar, enter key, ALT, CTRL, and the Special Key(Windows/Linux key).</p>

      <p>A standard keyboard has a layout of around 104 keys, ANSI or ISO, and is QWERTY. There are 104 keys and buttons on the keyboard that come in many different variations. A standard keyboard starts at 100% and has 104 keys. They continue on to 80% which is also known as Tenkeyless, with around 80 keys, to 60% which has around 65 keys, and finally 40% which has 40 keys. All of these keyboard variations come in handy depending on the task you are using them for.</p>
