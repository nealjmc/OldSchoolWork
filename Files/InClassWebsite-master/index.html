    Mechanical keyboards come in all shapes and sizes. There are communities around the world with all types of people who love keyboards. There are forums, meetups, group buys, and much more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mechanical keyboards are something you can customize to your liking. Itâ€™s something you can use to express yourself, and make yours. No matter what you like, there will always be something out there for you! There are even websites dedicated for helping you design your own themes and/or layouts!
  </p>
  <p>
    Keyboards have many different layouts and styles which again, is something that you can customize. The standard keyboard in North America has a 104 key, QWERTY, ISO or ANSI layout, with either rubbers domes, or membrane. Mechanical keyboards can be as low as a 40% (around 40 keys) and as high as 100% (104 keys), with many variants in between.
