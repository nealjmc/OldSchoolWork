    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I have liked to figure out how things works since I was little. How they all fit together to make something else was always interesting. This is what got me into computers, and in turn lead me to programming. Being able to use something that you built feels amazing.. Programming is just that, you have a problem and you make the solution. Once you find that solution, you can perfect it and have other people use that same solution. </p>

    <p>Mechanical keyboards is just a hobby I have. Mind you itâ€™s something I cannot afford, but I still enjoy it. The community online is super friendly and helpful if you have problems, or are considering buying one. You are able to find out common problems, how to clean them properly, and more. There are also meetups quite frequently, where people from all over the world go just to share what they love. </p>

    <p>Over the summer I worked at a Internet Service Provider, and had the chance to work in programming with: JavaScript, JSON, mySQL, .Net, ASP, C#, HTML, and CSS. This gave me a lot of experience in one summer. I am now currently enrolled at St. Lawrence College, taking the Computer Programmer Analyst course. So far I have learned a number of new programming techniques, and proper procedures from there. I have made this website with the help of my courses, and some of my own experience.</p>
